**Daniel Park + Max Stopyra's Midterm Project Proposal**

***The multiple proposals shown below in order of preference***

*Proposal One: The Perfect (Grammy) Song of the Year*

Research Question: What is the perfect song concoction of composers, performer(s), and genre to most likely win a Grammy for 'Best Song of the Year'?

Data: We will use the data from a Wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Song_of_the_Year) that contains the past winners of the 'Best Song of the Year' Grammy.

Visuals: We will represent our data with histograms to show us the most common elements in a Grammary-winning song from composers, performer(s), and genre.

**Proposal Two: The Perfect Soccer Player of the Year**

Research Question: What kind of player would be the perfect player to win a Ballon d'Or (soccer's prize for Best Player of the Year)?

Data: We will use the data from a Wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballon_d%27Or) that contains all the winners of the Ballon d'Or from the introduction of the award to the present day.

Visuals: We will represent our data with histograms to show us the most common elements of previous winners and show us the best qualities of the best player from position, nationality, team, and height.

**Proposal Three: SAT Assessment Factors**

Research Question: What are the aspects of a test taker's identity that correlate to better SAT scores?

Data: We will use data identifying different parts of a person's identity from CollegeBoard (https://research.collegeboard.org/programs/sat/data/archived/2018-sat-suite-annual-report) and their corresponding mean scores. 

Visuals: We will use multiple histograms to seperate different independent variables and compare different categories in each variable to each other to show the effects a category has on an average SAT score.
