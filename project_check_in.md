**Daniel Park + Max Stopyra's Midterm Project Check-in**

**Data**: We currently have all the data we need into a total database (removed nominees and references column). We also have a dataframe with a list of all the nationalities that can be analyzed.

**Reflection**: Although we have the process of making a dataframe down and have a good portion of our data secured, we still need to figure out a way to get information from within an embedded link and also find out a way to compare the list of the names of the winners to the names of the performing artists. We are even considering moving onto a different question with a much cleaner table to avoid going through the hassle of hard-coding any discrepencies not picked up by the code.

**Planning**: We still need to parse the winners' names and get them into a dataframe to compare them to the performing artists' names. We also need to get the data from within the songs' links and get the song's genre. And if possible, we would switch gears into a different question with a different dataset here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_by_revenue
